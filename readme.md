- What is a headless browser?
A headless browser is a web browser without a graphical user interface. In other words it is a browser, a piece of software, that access web pages but doesn't show them to any human being. They're actually used to provide the content of web pages to other programs.Oct 7, 2009

- What is Selenium?
Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) also be automated as well.

Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.


- What is yml?
the extension for a yaml file, a human-readable data serialization language that takes concepts from programming languages such as C, Perl, and Python, and ideas from XML and the data format of electronic mail (RFC 2822). YAML was first proposed by Clark Evans in 2001,[1] who designed it together with Ingy d√∂t Net[2] and Oren Ben-Kiki.[2] It is available for several programming languages.

- What is end to end testing?
End-to-end testing is a technique used to test whether the flow of an application right from start to finish is behaving as expected. The purpose of performing end-to-end testing is to identify system dependencies and to ensure that the data integrity is maintained between various system components and systems.

- What is continuous integration?
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

- What should be expect to happen if the lotion isn't in the basket?
it gets the hose again
